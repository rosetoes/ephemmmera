		<h1>HI HI HI!!!!</h1>
		<p>this is my first attempt to code something in html.</p>
		<p>i started with wordpress but it got really annoying and i'd rather just learn how to make a website from scratch even though i recognize that literally all i wanna do is make an image gallery for my drawings but FOR SOME REASON THAT'S REALLY HARD SO YOU KNOW WHAT I AM JUST GONNA LEARN A WHOLE NEW SKILL INSTEAD. lowkey i feel like such a programmer. so this is real fun for me. YAY. FOR LEARNING. some day i will have a real blog and it will be so damn funky but for now it will just be whatever this is.</p>
